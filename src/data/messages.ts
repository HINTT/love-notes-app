If you're reading this, it means I'm not there with you right now. But I want you to know that even when we're apart, you're always on my mind.

Every moment without you feels a little longer, every song reminds me of you, and every beautiful thing I see makes me wish you were there to share it with me.

You are my favorite person, my best friend, and the love of my life. Distance is just a number, and my heart will always find its way to you.

I love you more than words could ever express.

Forever yours ❤️`
